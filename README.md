The image above is the dashboard I managed to put together with the information from the Titanic dataset. The Tableau file and dataset can be downloaded for further analysis.

My goal with this project was to get a better understanding behind the mortality rate of the historical ships sinking.


# My findings were as follows:

* More than 60% of the ships passengers died.
* The highest survival and death rate was among people in their 20’s.
* Passengers in passenger class 1 were much more likely to survive.
* Passenger class 3’s death toll was more than class 1 and 2 combined.
* People with no spouse or sibling were much more likely to survive than others.
